# Gutenberg Text Cleaner

A Flask web application that allows users to fetch, clean, analyze, and summarize texts from Project Gutenberg URLs. This project is part of CSE 510's Scaffolding Assignment 3 on text preprocessing and web development.

---

## Overview

This web service fetches raw text from Project Gutenberg or any `.txt` URL, preprocesses the text by cleaning headers and footers, normalizes and tokenizes the text, and provides basic statistics along with a three-sentence summary. The project includes:

- A Flask backend with two API endpoints (`/api/clean` and `/api/analyze`)
- A simple and clean frontend interface to submit URLs and display results
- Text preprocessing methods implemented in `starter_preprocess.py`
- Integration of frontend and backend for real-time cleaning and analysis
